# Every format from one edit

## Scope and capability policy

User intent and acceptance criteria override this recipe's aesthetic defaults. Silent, typography-only, uncaptioned and slow work are valid; no universal narration, footage, CTA, beat count or score target. Contracts, factual fidelity, media bindings and current source revisions remain mandatory.

Read available tools and current project; preserve the chosen local/hosted lane. Supported local work needs no hosted registration. Do not silently install, authenticate, switch projects or upload local content. Before metered hosted work, check `get_account`, entitlements, balance and quotes. Desktop setup: https://docs.cueframe.ai.

For scoped revisions, preserve unrelated timing, media, audio and shared brand-kit state. Edit affected content; inspect relevant frames, continuous motion and affected audio. No restarted intake, new approval pause, paid judge or final export by default. Judge only when useful; scores never override acceptance failures. Stop/report after two no-improvement passes. See [preview workflow](../cueframe-compose-loop/references/preview-workflow.md).

You finish ONE edit; you get back its siblings for every platform — 9:16 for
Reels/TikTok/Shorts, 1:1 and 4:5 for feeds — derived content-aware from the master,
subject-tracked rather than letterboxed, each judged and rendered on its own. The edit decisions
are made once; the formats are a job, not a re-edit.

## Before you start

Confirm which master and which target platforms before setup. When the first tool call
approaches and CueFrame isn't connected, load **`cueframe-connect`** and follow it once.

Then straight to deriving — this whole job is minutes when the master is good.

## Inputs

- **The master composition** (required): a finished, approved edit — find it via
  `list_compositions` if the user doesn't have the id. If the master isn't done, finish it first
  (this skill multiplies quality AND flaws).
- **Target aspects**: default all three siblings — 9:16, 1:1, 4:5. The documented derive lane
  starts from a 16:9 master.
- **Per-platform tweaks**: default none — determinism is the point. Take an explicit ask (e.g.
  "shorter for TikTok") as a separate edit on the derived sibling.

## Workflow

Use `cueframe-compose-loop`'s [preview workflow](../cueframe-compose-loop/references/preview-workflow.md)
for each affected sibling. Check motion as well as layout where the new crop changes visibility.
A correction to one sibling does not require rendering the master or the other unchanged siblings.

1. **Verify the master is actually done.** It passed its class checklist, its audio was
   decided, its render was approved. Deriving from a draft ships the draft's flaws four times.
2. **Derive each sibling.** `derive_composition` per target aspect — the reframe is
   content-aware: it tracks the subject into the new frame instead of letterboxing. Each
   sibling is a real composition you can edit independently afterward; the master is never
   touched.
3. **Audit every sibling on real pixels — required, not optional.** `preview_frame` each
   sibling at t=0, hook-end, and each card's midpoint; describe each still. What to look for
   per aspect: the subject's head fully in the vertical frame; cards and captions inside the
   safe area (no critical copy in the outer ~8%); no beat where the tighter crop lost the thing
   the beat exists to show.
4. **Fix per-sibling, surgically.** Where a crop or card misbehaves, `apply_composition` on
   THAT sibling — nudge a `setCropIntents` segment, resize a card for the narrower frame
   (re-apply its `clip.setKeyframes` if you replace the card). Don't
   re-edit the story; the story is the master's.
5. **Confirm the audio carried.** The master's decided audio — bed, ducking, beat-aligned cuts
   (`materializeGrid` markers), or its intentional silence — rides into each sibling. Verify
   the bed is present and the silence decision, if any, still holds; the sibling's delivery
   note repeats it. If a sibling needs a different bed, `search_resources` honoring the brand
   kit's `musicMood` and swap it on that sibling only.
6. **Judge each sibling as its own artifact.** `score_composition` per sibling with the
   master's vision as `editorialIntent`. Changing aspect ratio does not change the approved editorial intent, pacing or acceptance criteria. Fix worst-first to
   meet the applicable acceptance criteria.
7. **Render each approved sibling.** `create_render` → `wait_job (kind:"render")` per
   composition. One final render per approval; iterate with previews.

## What good looks like

Quoted from `video-craft-standards` (cross-cutting rules — every artifact):

> **DEFAULT** Safe-area respected: no critical copy in the outer ~8% of frame.

> **DEFAULT** One final render per approval; iterate with previews, not renders.

> **DEFAULT** Delivery never ends with "done": the last message carries the output link and where
> to find it, plus the intentional-silence note if any.

And the class rule that governs each sibling: apply the original brief at the new dimensions; aspect ratio alone does not impose a social-reel hook or pacing. Derivation
changes the frame, never the bar.

## Delivering

The last message is a manifest, never "done":

- Every sibling's render link, labeled by aspect and platform, and where each lives (project +
  composition id — the master's id too, since it stays the source of truth).
- The master's attribution list (it covers all siblings — same assets).
- The intentional-silence note, restated once, if the master chose silence.
- Any sibling-specific edits you made (which crop nudged, which card resized) so future master
  edits know what to re-check after re-deriving.
