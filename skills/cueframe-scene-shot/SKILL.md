# CueFrame scene shots

Use the [project and capability policy](../composing-video/references/project-policy.md) for scope, current state and metered work.

Use `scene.add` and `scene.update` through `apply_composition`. Author the scene JSON; CueFrame owns the generated wrapper, preparation, resource admission, previews, and export.

Before authoring, read `cueframe://scene-shot`. It serves the canonical generated `SceneShotSpecV2` schema, exact operation contracts, supported brand tokens, refusal rules, and a copyable nested slab-and-page recipe. Do not infer fields from an older example.

On the CueFrame desktop app that resource is unreachable — its MCP surface is tools-only and no `cueframe://` URI resolves there. Call the `get_scene_contract` tool instead: same document, served in sections (`essentials` by default, then `rules` and `schema`).

## Workflow

Use `cueframe-compose-loop`'s [preview workflow](../cueframe-compose-loop/references/preview-workflow.md)
for the available hosted/local lane. Inspect affected camera/focus/entrance windows in motion,
not only keyframes. A scene tweak can finish with preview evidence; export for final delivery.

1. Create or open a composition at the target aspect and FPS.
2. Register every image, video, model, or environment asset through the supported media workflow. Bind owned media ids to the declared slots; retain the exact asset bytes for restoration. Capture-backed component surfaces use an exact component id, source version id, capture frame, layout, and optional bake scale.
3. Read `cueframe://scene-shot` (desktop: `get_scene_contract`), copy its `world-objects` recipe, and replace placeholder ids and copy.
4. Send `apply_composition` with `dry_run: true`. Fix the exact reported field path.
5. Apply the same batch for real. Preview the first frame, object entrances, focus transitions, and the last frame.
6. Revise with `scene.update`; do not hand-edit a generated wrapper.
7. Render only after surfaces report ready and the previews show the intended pixels.

## Ownership boundaries

The composition owns clip start, duration, ordering, cuts, and transitions. The scene owns objects, camera, environment, backdrop, post effects, constraints, and normalized animation. Scene clips occupy a dedicated full-frame front overlay track. Outer region, position, scale, rotation, fit, clip effects, and internal fades are refused because they would create two transform or timing owners.

`referenceSize` must have the same aspect ratio as the composition. World coordinates are reference pixels with origin at frame center, +X right, +Y up, and +Z toward the default viewer. World rotations use radians in Euler XYZ order; laptop `openAngle` uses radians in [0, PI]. Equal-aspect outputs scale uniformly.

Animation keyframe `at` is normalized over clip duration. Easing belongs to the keyframe it arrives at. The first keyframe has no easing; each later keyframe supplies `linear`, `hold`, or cubic `bezier` easing. Topology, bindings, text content, fonts, material roles, and object kind remain static within a shot.

## Objects and surfaces

V2 supports nested `group` layers and canonical `slab`, `page`, `phone`, `laptop`, `text`, `mesh`, and `model` layers. Use only capabilities and profiles returned by the installed contract. Use each object's declared surface slot:

- `source: "image"` binds an admitted PNG, JPEG, or WebP through the outer `assets` map.
- `source: "component"` captures an immutable component source at the declared frame and layout. Omitted `bakeScale` lets preparation select 2× or 3×; an explicit insufficient scale refuses.
- `source: "video"` binds an admitted media id with frame-addressed start/end facts. Video decoding and committed-frame readiness are sealed before drawing.
- `source: "color"` supplies an unlit solid surface.

Never insert a URL, raw HTML, shader source, or placeholder art into a surface. Every required slot must resolve before capture. UI surfaces and world text are unlit and color-managed; bodies use declared physical material roles. Invisible objects do not write depth.

World text participates in camera, depth, occlusion, and focus. Screen text stays fixed above the world result. Both are line-authored with no automatic reflow. Every exact font family, weight, and style used by base or emphasized runs must be admitted.

Meshes use bounded indexed geometry with positions, normals, UVs and indices, or a tube described by points and segment counts. Keep topology static; use declared transforms and material controls for motion. Static instances share the admitted geometry where the contract permits them.

Models bind an owned GLB data asset through `assetSlot`. Select `static-glb-untextured-v1` or `static-glb-textured-v1` explicitly. The textured profile admits bounded embedded PNG/JPEG images; external image/buffer URLs, unsupported extensions/codecs, animation, skeletons and subnode editing remain refused. Model-level transforms are editable. Scalar material overrides must carry the exact bound `materialSourceSha256`; do not reuse an override against a replacement asset with another digest. Read the live profile's bounds before choosing an input file.

## Shader fields

Use `mesh.shader` only when the installed contract advertises `stateless-fragment-display-linear-v1`. It requires UV geometry, no instances or physical material override, and effective opacity 1 throughout its parent hierarchy. This is an opaque field material, not arbitrary GLSL or a surface binding.

The source defines `vec3 field(vec2 uv, vec3 localPosition)`. Uniforms are finite typed values; samplers name owned PNG/JPEG image slots with `colorSpace: "srgb"` for color or `"data"` for numeric samples. Shader images use fixed linear filtering and clamp wrapping without mipmaps; supported model textures retain their declared glTF samplers. The engine provides `cfFrame`, `cfRate`, `cfTime`, `cfSeed` and `cfResolution`. Use those clock/seed inputs for repeatable motion. Return display-linear RGB; the fixed wrapper clamps finite output to [0, 1], replaces non-finite components with zero, and writes alpha 1.

For example, this shader descriptor produces a field controlled by two editable colors:

```json
{
  "profile": "stateless-fragment-display-linear-v1",
  "source": "vec3 field(vec2 uv, vec3 localPosition) { return mix(tintA, tintB, clamp(uv.x, 0.0, 1.0)); }",
  "uniforms": {
    "tintA": { "type": "vec3", "value": [0.02, 0.08, 0.3] },
    "tintB": { "type": "vec3", "value": [0.8, 0.15, 0.03] }
  },
  "samplers": {}
}
```

The profile bounds source size, parsed structure, expanded operations and texture samples; it allows at most 32 uniforms and 4 samplers. Loops, recursion, macros, extensions, derivatives, depth writes, feedback and scene-color/depth sampling are refused. Fix the returned source location or field path instead of bypassing the profile. Both live preview and capture must finish preparation and compile/draw readiness on their actual graphics context. A successful capture does not prove a different preview driver works.

## Lighting and post

Choose the generated studio environment for named studio profiles or `{kind:"photographic-studio-v1"}` for the fixed photographic recipe. An owned environment uses `{kind:"owned-hdr-v1",assetSlot,intensity,rotation}` and an admitted RGBE 1024×512 data asset, at most 8 MiB encoded. External HDR URLs and other unadvertised profiles remain refused. Backdrops may be transparent, solid, linear, or radial. Focus is per-pixel world depth; sample the actual object face rather than its layer origin when choosing distance and range.

Use physical material fields only on the declared body roles. Transmission, thickness, attenuation and dispersion require the executing route's admitted resource profile; they are not unlit UI-surface controls. Verify the background and lighting through the transmitted object in motion. `post.bloom` uses `display-linear-bloom-v1` with strength, threshold, smoothing and radius, followed by grain/vignette. Read the installed ranges and budget refusals; zero/off bloom preserves the ordinary post path. These capabilities do not establish fidelity to a reference without inspecting the saved output.

Brand tokens are allowed only in schema-declared color and font-family fields. Read the token enums from the resource. A font token resolves the family only; authored weight and style still require exact admitted bytes.

## Limits and refusals

The contract admits at most 32 layers, 4 devices, 16 distinct image slots, 256 keyframes per channel, and 2048 keyframes per shot, with additional per-profile geometry, decode and GPU budgets. Raw HTML, arbitrary shader properties or full GLSL, unsupported GLB/HDR profiles, skeletal animation and physics remain unsupported. Unknown keys, duplicate ids, missing bindings, non-finite values, aspect mismatch, budget overflow, and unsupported capabilities fail with a named code and exact path.

Composition-level global wrap effects do not reach front-overlay scene clips. Author bloom, grain, vignette, focus, backdrop, and environment inside the scene.

## Delivery checks

- The rendered subject is a real object with a real admitted surface.
- Every key entrance, reflection sweep, screen update, and focus transition was previewed.
- Device and slab bodies receive the intended light while UI colors remain unchanged.
- Text uses the intended admitted face and remains legible.
- The output aspect matches the authored reference aspect.
- The final response identifies the composition, render, source provenance, and any intentional unsupported boundary.
